As an exhibitor, you are no doubt aware that exhibitions cost money. The more thoroughly and intensively you prepare for your participation in the exhibition, the greater the benefits will be. For this reason, you should use all instruments at your disposal to their best effect, both prior to the event and afterwards. Press work, together with advertising, is of the utmost importance for sales strategies as well as for the overall and external representation of a company. Please note: press work is an extremely important part of your presence at an exhibition. The best product or the most amazing new idea is wasted if the public or trade visitors do not get to hear about it in good time.  Conclusion: DTouch Group is a one stop shop for all you advertising and Exhibition needs.
